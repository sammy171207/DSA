# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Practice

Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) repository! This is a personal space where I learn, practice, and improve my problem-solving skills by exploring various DSA topics. The goal is to consistently practice daily and build a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures.

## 📚 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each representing a specific topic in DSA:

- **Arrays**  
- **Strings**  
- **Linked Lists**  
- **Stacks and Queues**  
- **Trees**  
- **Graphs**  
- **Dynamic Programming**  
- **Recursion and Backtracking**  
- **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**  
- **Mathematics and Bit Manipulation**  

---

## 🚀 Goals

1. **Daily Practice**: Solve at least one problem every day.  
2. **Learn New Concepts**: Explore and implement advanced algorithms and data structures.  
3. **Optimize Solutions**: Improve problem-solving efficiency by optimizing time and space complexities.  
4. **Interview Preparation**: Focus on common interview questions and scenarios.
